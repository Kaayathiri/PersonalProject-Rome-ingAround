                <strong><h1 class="font-weight-light">About Rome</h1></strong>
                <p class="lead">Rome was once the largest, wealthiest, most powerful city in the Western world. It’s no wonder that today Rome is packed with countless historical landmarks, museums and over 900 churches.</p>
                <h4 class="heading">When is the best time to visit Rome?</h4>
                <p class="lead">Three days should be enough time to take in Rome’s main sights but choose your dates carefully. Rome will always be busy but the best times of year to go are the shoulder seasons in April, May, late September or October. Flight prices tend to drop a little in shoulder season. In summer the city is almost unbearable because of the heat and crowding so you may want to avoid June and July. August sees the whole of Italy taking a break so Rome gets doubly packed. In December and January many attractions cut their opening days and times.</p>

                <p class="lead">Few cities can rival Rome's astonishing artistic heritage. Throughout history, the city has starred in the great upheavals of Western art, drawing top artists and inspiring them to push the boundaries of creative achievement. The result is a city awash with priceless treasures. Ancient statues adorn world-class museums; Byzantine mosaics and Renaissance frescoes dazzle in art-rich churches; baroque facades flank medieval piazzas. Stroll through the centre and without even trying you’ll come across masterpieces by the titans of European art – sculptures by Michelangelo, paintings by Caravaggio, frescoes by Raphael and fountains by Bernini.</p>
